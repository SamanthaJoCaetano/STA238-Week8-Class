First let's load in the Starbucks data. 

```{r, include=FALSE}
starbucks<-read_csv("starbucks.csv")
```


## For all Pastries

Now, let's look at the mean, standard deviation and sample size of the calorie variable.

```{r}
starbucks %>%   
  summarise(
  mean_cal = mean(calories),
  sd_cal = sd(calories),
  n_cal = n())

```


Or in base R:

```{r}
xbar_cal <- mean(starbucks$calories)
s_cal <- sd(starbucks$calories)
n_cal <- length(starbucks$calories)
```

The 95% CI for mean calories is ......


## For Petite Pastries only

```{r}
## Use some type of filtering to get only type=="petite"


```

```{r}
## Now calculate the mean, sd and sample size of the petite pastry calories.


```


The 95% CI for mean calories in petite pastries is .......
